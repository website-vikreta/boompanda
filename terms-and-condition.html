                </p>

                <h5>Cashbacks/Rewards</h5>
                <p>
                    After a Member successfully completes a Qualifying Transaction/Activity, and once we have received
                    the resulting Payment/Fees/Cashback for that Qualifying Transaction/Activity, we pass that
                    Reward/Cashback to the Member to his/her Wallet which can be then withdrawn through various methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that there are various circumstances in which a transaction with a Retailer may not
                    constitute a Qualifying Transaction, or Cashback may not result from it. The Member understands that
                    some transactions made by him/her may not be with us, but with the individual Brand/Retailer. Our
                    support team provide further information about these circumstances. Further, from time to time
                    Brands/Retailers may increase or decrease the commission paid – in which case the cashback offer
                    illustrated on our Platform may be incorrect. By default, your applicable transactions will be
                    credited in line with the commission reported to us by the Brand/Retailer, which may be more or less
                    than the advertised rate. We shall not be liable for any difference in the expected cashback by the
                    Member and the actual Cashback received by the Member.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we have traced a paying, Qualifying Transaction to your Account, we will credit your Account
                    with a 'pending payment'. Once the Retailer confirms the transaction, the payment will be marked as
                    'validated' – this can take 90 days or more from the date of the purchase. If the goods are returned
                    or the sale reversed or amended by any means, then the reward/cashback payment will not be made.
                    Apart from the Brand/Retailer, it is also mandatory for the members to intimate BoomPanda about any
                    returns or exchanges for which they might have earned cashback unduly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether a transaction shall qualify as a Qualifying for reward/cashback Transaction shall be at the
                    sole discretion of the Brand/Retailer or us and the Member understands and agrees to the same. We
                    shall not be held responsible if the Brand/Retailer fails to report a sale to us or does not qualify
                    a transaction as Qualifying Transaction. Further, we shall not be responsible in the event due to
                    some technical or other error we cannot trace an Activity back to the Member and does not qualify
                    the transaction as a Qualifying Transaction for any reason whatsoever. Whilst we will endeavour to
                    recuperate non-payments from the Brand/Retailer, the decision of ourselves, the Retailer or
                    Retailer's tracking agent is final. Whilst we will try and recuperate missing commissions, at any
                    point we reserve the right not to chase missing commission claims, particularly where no activity
                    has been performed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further, in the event that the Brand/Retailer feels that the activity is not genuine for any reason
                    whatsoever and we do not receive any Payment/Fees/Cashback for the transaction, the Member will not
                    receive any Reward/Cashback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a Member sends us an enquiry on missing cashback, our system would check if the user had an
                    exit click from our Platform for that store on the date mentioned by the user. If no exit clicks can
                    be tracked, then we will show a message to the Member indicating that they did not click via our
                    website to earn cashback prior to the sale. All exit clicks to stores are saved in the database for
                    cross reference on adding cashback values. Where a commission enquiry has been successfully paid by
                    a Brand/Retailer, you may receive a lower amount than expected; this is due to the amounts received
                    by ourselves possibly being lower than the original claim. We do allow you to query this with us. If
                    a Brand/Retailer still hasn't paid a manual commission claim after a period of six months, then we
                    reserve the right to close the enquiry claim. All payment for Missing Reward/Cashback is only
                    applicable in instances where the Brand/Retailer pays BoomPanda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We reserve the right to reclaim or make balance adjustments accordingly where it has been
                    established that any credit has been applied in error. This will include but is not limited to
                    transactions where the credit is not genuinely due or payment for any credited transaction has not
                    been received from a Brand/Retailer or its agencies and/or misuse or fraud. This can include
                    transactions which are already marked as payable or validated in your Account, or for transactions
                    which have already been paid over to you by Paytm,NEFT, Cheque, Gift Cards or any other payment
                    modes as We may introduce from time to time. In all such incidences, BoomPanda has the right to
                    recover all unduly paid cashback which the member is not entitled to earn, through legal
                    proceedings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various circumstances in which Reward/Cashback will not be payable to the Member, and will
                    be forfeited to us, these could be, without limitation:
                </p>
                <p>
                    where the cashback payment that we receive is not attributed to a Qualifying Transaction or
                    associated with an Account (such as where the Member is not logged-in to our Platform when making
                    the relevant activity/purchase)
                </p>
                <p>
                    the transaction to which the Cashback relates is cancelled after it has been entered into (whether
                    under the right of cancellation that applies to some activities made at a distance, or otherwise)
                    the Reward/Cashback is attributed to a Member or Account that has been: suspended by us for any
                    reason; associated with any fraudulent activity or any breach of this Agreement.
                </p>

                <h5 id="refund">Refunds and Cancellation </h5>
                <p>
                    In case of canceled/failed transactions billed to the user, the refund will be issued to the
                    original source of payment where it takes 5-7 working days for the refunds to reach the users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case of any Activity or Offer has been stopped by us (i.e. BoomPanda) due to any reason and if
                    the user has already paid for that particular Activity or Offer, the refund amount (for which refund
                    has been subsequently received from the respective third-party/parties), the Company may issue
                    BoomCoins of an equivalent amount to the Customer. You may note that withdrawing BoomCoins is
                    allowed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not liable to pay any refunds to the users for any cancellations if they are not caused
                    directly by us (i.e. BoomPanda), any third party/parties are responsible for it where we have
                    already transferred the amount to the third party/parties and we have yet not received the refund
                    from the concerned third party/parties.
