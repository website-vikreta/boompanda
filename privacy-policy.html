                    acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), Your Personal Information may be among the items

                <h5>How do we protect your information?</h5>
                <p>
                    When You access Our Platform(s),
                    We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. We only provide articles and
                    information. We never ask for credit card numbers. We use regular Malware Scanning. Your personal
                    information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of
                    persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information
                    confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure
                    Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We implement a variety of security measures when a user engages with
                    website and enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal
                    information. All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or
                    processed on our servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the existing environment, We cannot ensure that all of Your Personal Information will never
                    be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. Therefore, although We use industry
                    standard practices to protect Your privacy, We do not promise, and You should not expect, that Your
                    Personal Information will always remain private. Your Personal Information may be stored and
                    processed in India or any other country in which We or Our Service Providers or third-parties, as
                    referred in this Policy, maintain facilities. We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep
                    the information collected through the Platform(s) secure and take reasonable steps (such as
                    requesting a unique password) to verify Your identity before granting You access to Your account.
                    However, We cannot ensure the security of any information You transmit on the Platform(s) or
                    guarantee that information on the Platform(s) may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

                <h5>What are your rights?</h5>
                <p>
                    You may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (you may
                    have heard of this right being described as a "subject access request"). Please note that this right
                    entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you in order to enable you to
                    check that it is correct and to ensure that we are processing that personal data lawfully. It is not
                    a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific
                    documents from us that do not relate to your personal data. You can exercise this right at any time
                    by writing to us using contact details set out here and telling us that you are making a subject
                    access request. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe
                    is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we
                    need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be
                    forgotten”). Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may
                    take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are
                    not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we
                    have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase we will tell
                    you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request. You can exercise this right at any
                    time by writing to us using the contact details set out here and telling us that you are making a
                    request to have your personal data rectified or erased and on what basis you are making that
                    request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you should tell us what that new
                    data is. You can write to us to make such request.

                    The European Union GDPR is a regulation that protects the privacy and security of personal data
                    collected from individuals within the territory of the European Union (“EU data subjects”). It
                    applies to organizations established outside of the EU if they: (i) process the personal data of EU
                    data subjects when offering them goods or services; or (ii) monitor the behavior of EU data
                    subjects. BoomPanda neither offers goods or services to EU data subjects nor monitors their
                    behavior. Therefore, the GDPR does not directly apply to Us. However, We may work with organizations
                    that collect or process personal data of EU data subjects, that are subject to the GDPR. BoomPanda
                    agrees to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to provide a level of
                    security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing and the nature of the
                    personal data to be protected. In all such instances, We shall process the Personal Information of
                    EU data subjects solely on behalf of and at the direction of the organizations that provide Personal
                    Information to Us for processing.

                    California Online Privacy Protection Act: CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require
                    commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well
                    beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world)
                    that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to
                    post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
                    those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: California Online

                    COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) When it comes to the collection of personal
                    information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection
                    Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer
                    protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
                    services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to
                    children under the age of 13 years old.

                    Fair Information Practices: The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
                    law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the
                    development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
                    Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
                    that protect personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                    should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email within 14 business days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                    legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
                    law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users,
                    but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
                    prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

                    sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
